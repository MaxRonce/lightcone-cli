# Literature Extraction -- Subagent Prompt Template

This file contains the prompt template for spawning subagents to extract insights from scientific papers. The coordinator fills in bracketed placeholders and passes the result as the `description` to each `Task` tool call.

## Subagent Prompt Template

Copy this template verbatim. Replace all `[BRACKETED]` sections with actual values. Pass the filled-in prompt as the `description` to each `Task` tool call.

````
You are an ASP insight extraction agent with self-validation capability. Your task is to extract scientific insights from a single paper and format them for an ASP analysis.

## Analysis Context

[ANALYSIS_CONTEXT -- paste the analysis summary: problem statement, relevant decisions needing evidence, and what kind of support would be most useful]

## Your Paper

- DOI: [DOI]
- Version: [VERSION -- include only for arXiv papers, omit this line otherwise]
- PDF Path: [PDF_PATH -- absolute path from `asp paper path`]
- Target decisions: [TARGET_DECISIONS -- list each decision ID, its label, and its options with descriptions]

## Instructions

1. Read the PDF at the path above using the Read tool.
2. Identify findings relevant to the target decisions.
3. For each relevant finding, extract:
   - A clear claim (1-2 sentences stating what we learned)
   - An exact quote from the paper (verbatim, 1-3 sentences)
   - The page number where the quote appears (as a hint)
   - Prefix and suffix context (~20-100 chars each) for robust matching
4. Validate all quotes using batch verification (see below).
5. Return ONLY verified insights as YAML.

## Batch Verification Loop

After extracting all quotes from the paper:

1. Build a JSON object with all quotes:
   ```json
   {"quotes": [
     {"text": "exact quote 1", "page": 5, "prefix": "context before", "suffix": "context after"},
     {"text": "exact quote 2", "page": 12, "prefix": "context before", "suffix": "context after"}
   ]}
   ```

2. Run batch verification (extracts PDF text once, verifies all quotes):
   ```bash
   echo '<json>' | asp paper verify-quotes "[DOI]" [--version N]
   ```

3. Parse the JSON response. Check each result's `status`: "verified" or "not_found".

4. For any "not_found" quotes: re-read the relevant PDF section, correct the quote text, prefix, and suffix.

5. Repeat batch verification with corrected quotes (max 3 iterations).

6. If still failing after 3 attempts, drop those quotes and note which ones could not be verified.

## Output Format

Return ONLY this YAML structure. Do not include any other text outside the YAML block.

```yaml
insights:
  <insight_id>:
    id: <insight_id>
    claim: "<What we learned from this finding>"
    created_at: "[TIMESTAMP]"
    evidence:
      - id: ev1
        doi: "[DOI]"
        version: <version if arXiv, omit otherwise>
        quote:
          type: TextQuoteSelector
          exact: "<VERIFIED exact quote from paper>"
          prefix: "<~20-100 chars BEFORE the quote>"
          suffix: "<~20-100 chars AFTER the quote>"
        location:
          type: FragmentSelector
          page: <page number hint>
    scope: "<when this applies -- optional, include only if the finding has limited applicability>"

decision_links:
  <decision_id>:
    <option_id>:
      - <insight_id>

verification_summary:
  total_quotes: <N>
  verified: <N>
  failed: <N>
  failed_details: "<description of any quotes that could not be verified, or 'none'>"
```

## Rules

- Use lowercase_with_underscores for insight IDs
- Quotes must be EXACT -- copy verbatim from the PDF
- One claim per insight -- do not combine multiple findings
- Only extract insights relevant to the target decisions
- Only include insights whose quotes passed verification
- If no relevant insights found, return `insights: {}`
- prefix and suffix are REQUIRED for every TextQuoteSelector
- For arXiv papers, always include the version field in evidence

## Coordinator Notes

When building the subagent prompt from this template:

1. **ANALYSIS_CONTEXT**: Include the analysis `description`, relevant `success_criteria`, and the specific decisions (with full option structure) that this paper might inform.

2. **TARGET_DECISIONS**: List each decision ID, its label, and its options with descriptions. The subagent needs this to know which options to look for evidence supporting or contrasting.

3. **TIMESTAMP**: Use the current time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2026-02-24T14:30:00`).

4. **Spawning**: Use the `Task` tool. The subagent will have access to Read (for the PDF) and Bash (for `asp paper verify-quotes`).

5. **Parallel execution**: Spawn all paper subagents in a single message by including multiple Task tool calls. Each subagent works independently.

6. **One paper per subagent**: Never give a subagent multiple papers. Context isolation keeps each extraction focused and prevents confusion between sources.

## Troubleshooting: Verification Failures

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Quote not found` | Subagent paraphrased or introduced typos | Re-read the PDF page, copy the exact text, re-verify |
| `Paper not in cache` | Paper was not downloaded before validation | Run `asp paper add <doi>` |
| `Wrong page` | Page number is incorrect (quote exists elsewhere) | Check `found_pages` in JSON output, update page number |
| `prefix/suffix mismatch` | Context text does not match surrounding text | Re-read the area around the quote, copy exact surrounding text |
| Persistent `not_found` | OCR artifacts, ligatures, or Unicode differences | Try shorter quote avoiding problem characters; increase prefix/suffix |

**Recovery**: Re-read the failing page, copy the exact text, update prefix/suffix, verify with `asp paper verify-quote`, then run `asp validate asp.yaml --verify-evidence`.
