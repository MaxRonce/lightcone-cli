# Skills

Lightcone ships agent guidance as bundled skills. The mature bundle today is
the Claude Code plugin, where skills are slash commands. There is also an
experimental Codex bundle with a smaller set of Codex-readable skill files.
The Codex bundle is useful for ASTRA and `lc` workflow guidance, but it is not
yet a complete one-to-one port of every Claude workflow.

If you want to *use* these, start with
[The Agentic Workflow](../user/agent-workflow.md) in the user guide.
This page is for maintainers.

## Available skills

### Claude Code bundle

The `/lc-from-*` family is parallel in what you start from: a question,
code, or a paper. `/lc-from-paper` is the entry point of a six-skill
paper-reproduction bundle; the five siblings stand alone and are
user-invokable directly.

### Project lifecycle

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [lc-new](lc-new.md) | `/lc-new` | Scope a research question into an `astra.yaml`, with optional literature extraction. |
| [lc-from-code](lc-from-code.md) | `/lc-from-code` | Wrap an existing codebase in ASTRA: scan, generate spec, parameterize, run. |
| [lc-from-paper](lc-from-paper.md) | `/lc-from-paper` | Reproduce a published paper in ASTRA — ORIENT-first driver that hands off to a ralph loop for the long middle. |
| [lc-feedback](lc-feedback.md) | `/lc-feedback` | File a GitHub issue against the right Lightcone repo with auto-collected context. |
| [ralph](ralph.md) | `/ralph` | Author a constitution and run a ralph loop against it. Used by `lc-from-paper` for the long middle; standalone for any other long-running work. |

### Paper-reproduction bundle (sibling skills)

Co-located with `lc-from-paper` so a single `lc init` brings the full
toolkit. Each stands alone and is user-invokable; `lc-from-paper`
dispatches them by role during the reproduction.

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [ralph](ralph.md) | `/ralph` | Loop substrate. `lc-from-paper`'s ORIENT invokes ralph's Authoring mode to draft the per-paper constitution; the loop launcher hands off after ORIENT lands; each iteration runs ralph's Loop protocol. Also user-invokable standalone (see the Project lifecycle row above). |
| [paper-extraction](paper-extraction.md) | `/paper-extraction` | Turn an arXiv ID or DOI into a standardized `work/reference/` directory: substrate, figures, tables, citations (with resolved DOIs), and a stub `astra.yaml`. |
| [narrative](narrative.md) | `/narrative` | Author the `narrative:` prose and decision `rationale:` against an existing `astra.yaml`, in paper-reproduction, retrofit, or co-drafting mode. |
| [figure-comparison](figure-comparison.md) | `/figure-comparison` | Build a self-contained HTML side-by-side: paper figures, tables, and numerics vs reproduced artifacts. |
| [check-sentence-by-sentence](check-sentence-by-sentence.md) | `/check-sentence-by-sentence` | Static audit of paper claims against code locations (`file:line` or `NOT FOUND`). |

See the [bundle README](https://github.com/LightconeResearch/lightcone-cli/blob/main/claude/lightcone/skills/README.md) for the rationale behind co-location vs plugin install.

### Reference skills (auto-primed via session-start)

Not entry points. Other skills invoke them — or Claude does, when a deeper reference would help — to load reference content into the working session. The session-start hook names both in its primer, so Claude knows they exist from the first turn.

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `astra` | `/astra` | Reference for the `astra.yaml` spec: structure, decisions, options, prior insights, findings, evidence, sub-analyses, narrative anchors, composition mechanics. |
| `lc-cli` | `/lc-cli` | Reference for `lc` workflow: commands, the Spec-Code Invariant, status interpretation, failure diagnosis, multiverse runs, publishing via WRROC. |

These intentionally stay out of the top-level README. Researchers use the project-lifecycle skills directly; the reference skills are infrastructure.

### Codex bundle

Codex projects are scaffolded with:

```bash
lc init --agent codex my-analysis
cd my-analysis
codex
```

The Codex bundle installs project instructions as `AGENTS.md`, skill guidance
under `.agents/skills/`, and `/lc-new` / `/lc-from-code` prompt aliases under
`.codex/prompts/`. It does not install `.claude/` or write `CLAUDE.md`.

Invoke Codex skills with `$lc-new`, `$lc-from-code`, or Codex's `/skills`
picker. The prompt aliases preserve the familiar slash names on Codex CLI
versions that load project-local prompts.

Current Codex skills:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `astra` | Reference for `astra.yaml` structure, decisions, recipes, and the spec-code invariant. |
| `lc-cli` | Reference for `lc run`, `lc status`, `lc verify`, failure handling, and provenance checks. |
| `lc-new` | Guidance for scoping a new analysis from a research question. |
| `lc-from-code` | Guidance for wrapping existing code in ASTRA and materializing outputs through `lc`. |

After relevant Codex-driven edits, run the checks that apply:

```bash
astra validate astra.yaml
lc run
lc status
lc verify
```

## How a skill is wired

Claude skills live at `claude/lightcone/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML
frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: lc-new
description: >
  Scope a new ASTRA analysis from a research question...
allowed-tools: Read, Write(astra.yaml), Edit(astra.yaml), Glob, Grep, Bash(astra:*), ...
argument-hint: "[DESCRIPTION]"
---
```

The frontmatter tells Claude Code which tools the skill may invoke
and what the slash command's argument hint looks like. The body is the
prompt itself: phase definitions, rules, references to guide files,
anti-patterns. Skills bundle their own helper scripts under `scripts/`
and longer prompt fragments under `assets/` when relevant.

Codex skills live at `codex/lightcone/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Their
frontmatter is intentionally simpler (`name` and `description`) and avoids
Claude-only fields such as `allowed-tools`.

## Plugin layout

└── scripts/*.sh                       # session lifecycle hooks (incl. session-start primer)
```

The plugin is force-included into the wheel via
`pyproject.toml::tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include`, so
`lc init` finds it whether you're running from source or PyPI.

The Codex bundle is co-located under `codex/lightcone/` and is also included
in the package.

## Other plugin files

The two reference *skills* (`/astra` and `/lc-cli`) live under `skills/` and are listed in the [Reference skills](#reference-skills-auto-primed-via-session-start) section above. Remaining plugin files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `claude/lightcone/agents/lc-extractor.md` | Literature extraction subagent invoked by `/lc-new`. |
| `claude/lightcone/scripts/session-start.sh` | Session-start hook — surfaces validation + materialization status and primes Claude with the substrate CLIs and reference skill names. |
