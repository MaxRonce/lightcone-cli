# Welcome to the user guide

`lightcone-cli` is a small toolchain that turns a research question into
a reproducible analysis. You describe what you're trying to learn,
a cli agent helps you turn that into a precise specification, and the
`lc` command line keeps the resulting code, decisions, and outputs in
sync thanks to the [**ASTRA**][astra] specification.

No need to write code by hand, **you stay in charge of the scientific choices**, the agent handles the implementation.

## What this guide covers

- [Install](install.md) — get the `lc` command line and Claude Code running on your
  machine or on a cluster.
- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) — create your first project,
  run it end-to-end, and understand what each piece does.
- [Codex Support](codex.md) — experimental Codex project scaffolding and
  workflow notes.
- [The Agentic Workflow](agent-workflow.md) — `/lc-new`,
  `/lc-from-code`, `/lc-from-paper`, and `/lc-feedback` — what each
  command does and when to reach for it.
- [Running on a Cluster](cluster.md) — taking your analysis to a SLURM
  HPC system, including Perlmutter-specific notes.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) — common issues and how to
  unstick them.
- [Glossary](glossary.md) — the terms that show up everywhere
  (universe, decision, manifest, …) explained in plain language.

## What you'll do, in three lines

!!! tip "Quick start"

    === "uv"
        ```bash
        uv tool install lightcone-cli
        lc init my-analysis && cd my-analysis
        claude
        # then, inside Claude Code,  run /lc-new
        ```

    === "pip"
        ```bash
        pip install lightcone-cli
        lc init my-analysis && cd my-analysis
        claude 
        # then, inside Claude Code: /lc-new
        ```

    === "Codex"
        ```bash
        uv tool install lightcone-cli
        lc init --agent codex my-analysis && cd my-analysis
        codex
        ```

That's the shortest possible path. The rest of the guide is the unhurried version.

## What lightcone-cli is *not*

- **A statistics package.** It runs your code; it doesn't compute
  things itself.
- **A workflow language.** Recipes in `astra.yaml` are short shell or
  Python commands, not a DSL. There's no learning curve beyond what's
  in [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
- **An IDE.** `lc` is a command-line tool; the agent surface lives
  inside an agent harness such as Claude Code or, experimentally, Codex.

If you'd rather skim the design and architecture, the
[maintainer docs](../maintainer.md) are the other half of this site.
